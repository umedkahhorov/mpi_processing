# Seismic Parallel Computation

## Description

We develop parallel computation examples for seismic data processing. Many seismic operations are naturally data-parallel, allowing independent processing of different traces, shot gathers, frequency slices, and more. This enables scalable, high-performance workflows using distributed computing tools.

Our implementation leverages MPI (Message Passing Interface), the industry-standard framework for parallel computing, along with Dask, a modern Python-native library for parallel and distributed processing.

## Dataset

The examples in this repository use the following open seismic datasets:
