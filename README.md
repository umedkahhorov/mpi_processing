# Seismic Parallel Computation

## Description

We develop parallel computation examples for seismic data processing. Many seismic operations are naturally data-parallel, allowing independent processing of different traces, shot gathers, frequency slices, and more. This enables scalable, high-performance workflows using distributed computing tools.

As we primarily use Python, our approach focuses on Python-compatible parallel processing tools. The two main frameworks used are MPI (Message Passing Interface), a widely adopted standard for distributed computing, and Dask, a modern library for parallel and scalable workflows in Python.

## Dataset

The examples in this repository use the following open seismic datasets:
